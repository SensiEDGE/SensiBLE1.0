Application Description 

 This firmware package includes Components Device Drivers, Board Support Package
 and example application for the following STMicroelectronics elements:
 - X-NUCLEO-IDB04A1/X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1 Bluetooth Low energy expansion boards
 - X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 Expansion board for four MEMS sensor devices:
       HTS221, LPS25H, LSM6DS0, LSM6DS3, LIS3MDL
 - X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 Expansion board for four MEMS sensor devices:
       HTS221, LPS22HB, LSM6DSL, LSM303AGR
 - X-NUCLEO-CCAM02M1 Digital MEMS microphones expansion board
 - NUCLEO-F446RE NUCLEO-F401RE NUCLEO-L476RG Nucleo boards
 - STEVAL-STLKT01V1 (SensorTile) evaluation board that contains the following components:
	. MEMS sensor devices: HTS221, LPS22HB, LSM303, LSM6DSM
	. digital microphone: MP34DT04
	. Gas Gauge IC with alarm output: STC3115
	
 - The MotionFX (iNEMOEngine PRO) suite uses advanced algorithms to integrate outputs
   from multiple MEMS sensors in a smartway, independent of environmental conditions,
   to reach optimal performance. Real-time motion-sensor data fusion is set to significantly
   improve the user experience, increasing accuracy, resolution, stability and response time.
 - MotionAR (iNEMOEngine PRO) software provides real-time activity recognition data 
   using MEMS accelerometer sensor
 - Excluding STM32 Nucleo F4xx, , MotionCP (iNEMOEngine PRO) software provides carry Position recognition data 
   using MEMS accelerometer sensor
 - Excluding STM32 Nucleo F4xx, , MotionGR (iNEMOEngine PRO) software provides carry Gesture recognition data 
   using MEMS accelerometer sensor
 - Excluding STEVAL-STLKT01V1, AcousticSL software provides real-time audio source localization using PCM signal audio
 - BlueVoiceADPCM software enables real-time half-duplex voice-over-Bluetooth low energy communication profile.
   It includes one characteristic for audio transmission and one for synchronization and it is responsible for audio encoding and periodical data
   transmission on Server side and for decoding of received voice data on Client side
 - USB device library (for only STEVAL-STLCS01V1) provides support of multi packet transfer to allow
   sending big amount of data without split them into max packet size transfers.

 The Example application initizializes all the Components and Library creating 3 Custom Bluetooth services:
 - The first service exposes all the HW and SW characteristics:
   . HW characteristics:
		. related to MEMS sensor devices: Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Magnetometer, Gyroscope and Accelleromenter
		  and Microphones Signal Noise dB level.
		. battery Gas Gauge (for only SensorTile) 
   . SW characteristics: the quaternions generated by the MotionFX library in short precision, the activity
     recognized using the MotionAR algorithm, the carry position recognized using the MotionCP algorithm (excluding STM32 Nucleo F4xx),
     the Gesture recognized using the MotionGR algorithm(excluding STM32 Nucleo F4xx), the audio source localization using the AcousticSL software (excluding STEVAL-STLKT01V1)
	 that provides real-time audio source localization, AcousticBF software (for only STM32 nucleo F4xx) provides real-time beam forming
	 using the audio signals acquired from two digital MEMS microphones, AcousticEC software (for only STM32 nucleo F4xx) provides real-time
	 acoustic echo cancellation. It uses BlueVoiceADPCM software for real-time half-duplex voice-over-Bluetooth low energy communication profile.
 - The second Service exposes the console services where we have stdin/stdout and stderr capabilities
 - The last Service is used for configuration purpose
 
 For NUCLEO boards the example application allows the user to control the initialization phase via UART.
 Launch a terminal application and set the UART port to 460800 bps, 8 bit, No Parity, 1 stop bit.
 For having the same UART functionality on SensorTile board, is necessary to recompile the code uncomment the line 87 
	//#define OSX_BMS_ENABLE_PRINTF
 on file:
	Projects\Multi\Applications\ALLMEMS1\Inc\ALLMEMS1_config.h file
 This enables the UART that starts with a delay of 10 Seconds for allowing the time to open the UART for looking the initialization phase.

 This example must be used with the related BlueMS Android/iOS application available on Play/itune store,
 in order to read the sent information by Bluetooth Low Energy protocol

                   ---------------------------------------------
                   | Important Hardware Additional Information |
			       ---------------------------------------------
1) Before to connect X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 with X-NUCLEO-IDB04A1 (or X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1) expansion board through the Arduino UNO R3 extension connector,
   remove the 0-ohm resistors SB25, SB26 and SB27 onto X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 board.
2) Before to connect X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 with X-NUCLEO-CCAM02M1 expansion board through the Arduino UNO R3 extension connector,
   on to X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 board remove these 0-ohm resistor:
   - for F4xx STM32 Nucleo motherboard remove SB25, SB26 and SB27
   - for L4 STM32 Nucleo motherboard remove SB25 if additional microphones are plugged on to X-NUCLEO-CCA02M1 board.
3) For only L4 STM32 Nucleo motherboard, before to connect the board X-NUCLEO-CCA02M1 with the STM32 L4 Nucleo motherboard through the Morpho connector layout, on to X-NUCLEO-CCA02M1 board:
   - close the solder bridges SB12, SB16 and open the solder bridges SB7, SB15 and SB17
   - if additional microphones are plugged, close the solder bridge SB17.
  
                              -----------------------
                              | VERY IMPORTANT (1): |
                              -----------------------
 1) This example support the Firmware-Over-The-Air (FOTA) update (for only X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1 Bluetooth
 Low energy expansion boards) using the BlueMS Android/iOS application (Version 3.0.0 or higher)
 2) This example must run starting at address 0x08004000 in memory and works ONLY if the BootLoader 
 is saved at the beginning of the FLASH (address 0x08000000)
 
 For each IDE (IAR/µVision/System Workbench), and for each platform (NUCLEO-F446RE/NUCLEO-F401RE/NUCLEO-L476RG/SensorTile),
 there are some scripts *.bat/*.sh that makes the following operations:
 - Full Flash Erase
 - Load the BootLoader on the rigth flash region
 - Load the Program (after the compilation) on the rigth flash region (This could be used for a FOTA)
 - Dump back one single binary that contain BootLoader+Program that could be 
   flashed at the flash beginning (address 0x08000000) (This COULD BE NOT used for FOTA)
 - Reset the board
 
                               -----------------------
                               | VERY IMPORTANT (2): |
                               -----------------------
It's necessary to choose the right Target configuration during the compilation.
If the code is compiled for IKS01A1 could not run if it's attached the X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 and vice versa.

                                --------------------
                                | KNOWN LIMITATION |
                                --------------------
 - Even if FP-SNS-ALLMEMS1 send 100quaternions/second with Bluetooth, the mobile devices could render only 60frames/second
 - FOTA does not work when using X-NUCLEO-IDB04A1
 - For NUCLEO-F446RE/NUCLEO-F401RE board, there is an hardware conflict between the boards X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 and the X-NUCLEO-CCA02M1.
   The hardware features of the LSM6DSL are disabled.

 The Magneto Calibration provided by MotionFX (INEMOEngine PRO) could be saved in FLASH.
 In this way it's not necessary to make again the calibration at every STM32 Nucleo board reset.

 For avoiding accidental erasure of the calibration data, for forcing a new calibration it is necessary to press 
 the blue user button on the STM32 Nucleo board 3 times in less than 2 seconds.
